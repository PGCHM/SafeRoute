    "**Banner Image Credit:** [Google Photorealistic 3D Maps Challenge](https://google3dmaps.devpost.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "SafeRoute is an innovative web application that transforms urban navigation by prioritizing personal safety through advanced geospatial technology and data visualization. By leveraging Google Maps Platform Photorealistic 3D Maps, our solution goes beyond traditional route planning, offering users a comprehensive, immersive experience that helps them navigate cities with confidence and security. This project aims to design and implement a safety-focused route planner that visualizes danger zones in a specific time of day (like areas with high crime rates) and finds safer routes to avoid the danger zones as much as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inspiration and Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Urban safety remains a critical concern for many individuals, particularly in large metropolitan areas. Existing navigation tools primarily focus on distance and time, overlooking crucial safety considerations. SafeRoute addresses this gap by:\n",
    "  - Integrating real-time crime data\n",
    "  - Visualizing potential danger zones\n",
    "  - Calculating safety scores, and risk scores\n",
    "  - Dynamically routing users through safer paths\n",
    "  - Providing an immersive, interactive experience\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Gamification Elements\n",
    "   - Safety Score: Users earn points for choosing safer routes\n",
    "   - Risk Visualization: Color-coded danger zones with interactive tooltips\n",
    "   - Personalized safety recommendations based on user preferences and historical data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Stack\n",
    "   - Frontend: React.js\n",
    "   - Development: Google Cloud Shell Scripter \n",
    "   - Mapping: Google Maps JavaScript API\n",
    "   - 3D Rendering: Google Maps Platform Photorealistic 3D Maps\n",
    "   - Data Integration: Crime API, Geospatial Data Services\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI and Geospatial Integration\n",
    "SafeRoute demonstrates advanced AI and geospatial capabilities through:\n",
    "   - Real-time route optimization\n",
    "   - Contextual safety recommendations\n",
    "   - Adaptive routing based on user feedback and historical data\n",
    "   - Machine learning algorithms for danger zone prediction (to do)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Google Maps Platform Integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Photorealistic 3D Maps\n",
    "   - Enables hyper-realistic urban environment rendering\n",
    "   - Provides depth and context to safety visualizations\n",
    "   - Allows users to understand route characteristics beyond traditional 2D maps\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Places API\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Identifies and annotates points of interest\n",
    "   - Enhances route recommendations with contextual safety information\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed implementations\n",
    "This implementation includes several safety-focused features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Safety Features:\n",
    "- Visualization of high and medium risk areas\n",
    "- Route calculation that avoids dangerous areas\n",
    "- `Safety score` for each route\n",
    "- `Time-based warnings for late night travel`\n",
    "- Alternative route suggestions\n",
    "- Real-time safety information\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Interactive Elements:\n",
    "- Address autocomplete\n",
    "- Time of day selection\n",
    "- Travel mode options (walking/transit)\n",
    "- Interactive map with danger zones\n",
    "- Clear safety information display\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Safety Calculations:\n",
    "- `Risk score` calculation based on proximity to danger zones\n",
    "- Route optimization for safety\n",
    "- `Time-based risk assessment`\n",
    "- Distance and duration estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This is a simplified example using mock data for danger zones - in a real implementation, it's desired to use actual crime statistics data from reliable sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your Google Maps API key in the `.env` and `index.html` files\n",
    "2. Enable these APIs in Google Cloud Console:\n",
    "   - Maps JavaScript API\n",
    "   - Places API\n",
    "   - Directions API, and Directions Matrix API\n",
    "   - Geocoding Library\n",
    "3. The code has been tested and run in Google Shell Editor. You would need to initiaze the environment through:\n",
    "   - `npm i`\n",
    "   - `npm start -- --port=8080`\n",
    "4. Then preview the website through the preview window, e.g., at `https://8080-<instance id>.cs-us-west1-wolo.cloudshell.dev/?authuser=0&redirectedPreviously=true`"

    "## Enhanced functionalities \n",
    "\n",
    "Focused on finding alternative routes, I have made these enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tAdded Risk Avoidance Controls:\n",
    "   - New toggle buttons for avoiding high-risk and all-risk areas\n",
    "   - Visual feedback for active avoidance settings\n",
    "   - Logical coupling between the buttons (avoiding medium risk automatically avoids high risk)\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tEnhanced Route Finding:\n",
    "   - Routes are now filtered based on risk avoidance settings\n",
    "   - Multiple alternative routes are generated and analyzed\n",
    "   - Each route is scored based on risk levels\n",
    "   - Routes that violate avoidance settings are filtered out\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tAlternative Routes Display:\n",
    "   - Added a new section showing alternative routes\n",
    "   - Each alternative shows distance, duration, and safety score\n",
    "   - Routes can be selected to view on the map\n",
    "   - Selected route is highlighted in the list\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tVisual Improvements:\n",
    "   - Color-coded buttons matching risk levels\n",
    "   - Active state styling for avoidance toggles\n",
    "   - Clear visual hierarchy for route alternatives\n",
    "   - Interactive route selection\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "## Key tech improvements and explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "The key improvements on the technical side contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Click Listener: A click event listener is attached to each segmentDiv within the updateSafetyInfo function. This ensures that when a segment description is clicked, the associated code executes.\n",
    "   - LatLngBounds: Inside the click listener, a LatLngBounds object is created. This object defines a rectangular area on the map. We extend the bounds to include all the points within the clicked segment.\n",
    "   - map.fitBounds(): The map.fitBounds(bounds) function is used to re-center and zoom the map so that the entire LatLngBounds (i.e., the clicked segment) is visible.\n",
    "   - Conditional 3D View: Added conditional 3D view based on the segmentLength. If the segment is shorter than a defined threshold (5km in the example), 3D is enabled. Adjust the threshold as you see fit for your application.\n",
    "   - map.setTilt() and map.setHeading(): Inside the conditional, map.setTilt() applies a tilt to the map view, creating the 3D perspective. Experiment with values between 0 (flat) and 90 (maximum tilt). map.setHeading() can rotate the map for optimal viewing. You can set this to be dynamic based on the orientation of the line segment for more advanced behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these changes, clicking on a route segment will now center and zoom to that segment, and for shorter segments also enable a 3D view. This allows for more detailed inspection of particular parts of the route."
